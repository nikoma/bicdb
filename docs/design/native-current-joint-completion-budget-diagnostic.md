# Current-joint completion budget diagnostic

Executed source d6331d1d611f4f31ccf960fa13b0897d02bfb92a, run 43253229007,
Core job 131304443885 compiled and failed the positive recovery acceptance in
61.11s at the first Complete RPC's original 4500ms deadline. The same-source
`current_joint_` controls separately passed 4/0 (48.83s); that is not the full
positive acceptance.

The positive run completed all three genuine CurrentJoint fences, promises,
canonical Abort3/native R3 assertions and native preparations. Read-only ZIP
inspection of artifact 13961016835 shows n1's catalogue **NativeCompleted R3**,
with serving checksum
`4443fc6cebf1b617d84d744bc4efea9f257a83819b5cf7d2ad512074fa0deb2f`;
n2 and n3 remain NativePrepared R3. Thus n1 reached durable native/catalogue
completion and its response is uncertain. This is not evidence that no Complete
or no NoData occurred. No Activate/ACK4/Strong R4 acceptance was reached.

JSON inspection is not an independent cold engine replay.

The successor adds only cfg(test) diagnostic spans. They observe the original
request/challenge/session/deadline and actual protocol selection, worker drain,
Ready QQ, post-QQ metadata authority, service/database acquisition, native
preflight/journal/WAL/readback, catalogue fsync, prepared-binding refresh,
receipt validation and response projection. RAII spans report incomplete early
returns, real remaining budgets and cancellation. Native/catalogue publication
markers describe actual returned storage operations and their actual R/H/B/SHA;
they do not mint authority or reclassify a timeout as a successful RPC.

All validation, network/lock order, foreign/local checks, original caller,
quorum tokens and 4500ms budget remain unchanged. No additional network,
journal acquisition or metadata/service lock is introduced. The next exact
focused run must locate the first exhausted boundary before any optimization.
Full recovery remains unqualified until actual Activate/ACK4/Strong succeeds.
